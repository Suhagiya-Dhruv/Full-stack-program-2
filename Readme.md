## Array Methods and Concepts

In JavaScript, arrays are a fundamental data structure that allow you to store and manipulate collections of data. This section provides an overview of some common array methods and concepts, as well as the distinction between shallow copy and deep copy.

### Array Methods

#### 1. `slice`

The `slice` method is used to create a new array by extracting a portion of an existing array. It takes two parameters, the start index and the end index, and returns a new array containing the elements within that range.

#### 2. `splice`

The `splice` method allows you to modify an array by adding or removing elements at a specified index. It can be used for both adding and removing elements from an array.

#### 3. `concat`

The `concat` method is used to combine two or more arrays, creating a new array that contains all the elements of the original arrays.

#### 4. `map`

The `map` method is used to create a new array by applying a provided function to each element of the original array. It returns a new array of the same length as the original.

#### 5. `filter`

The `filter` method creates a new array containing all elements from the original array that satisfy a given condition, as specified by a provided function.

#### 6. `reduce`

The `reduce` method is used to reduce an array to a single value by applying a specified function to each element, accumulating the results as it iterates through the array.

### Flatten

Flattening an array means converting a multi-dimensional or nested array into a single-dimensional array. This is often useful when you need to simplify complex data structures into a more manageable format.

In JavaScript, you can flatten an array using various techniques, including recursion and the `concat` method.

These array methods and concepts are fundamental for working with arrays in JavaScript. Understanding the difference between shallow and deep copies is crucial when dealing with complex data structures, and flattening arrays can help simplify data processing tasks.
