### Shallow Copy and Deep Copy

In JavaScript, when working with arrays or objects, it's important to understand the difference between shallow copy and deep copy.

- **Shallow Copy**: A shallow copy of an array or object creates a new reference to the original array or object. It copies the top-level structure but still references the same nested objects or arrays. Changes in the nested structures affect both the original and the copy.

- **Deep Copy**: A deep copy, on the other hand, creates a completely independent copy of the original array or object. It recursively copies all nested structures, ensuring that changes to the copy do not affect the original.

### Higer Order Function

In JavaScript, you can define Higher-Order Functions (HoFs) that either take a function as an argument and return a value or take a value as an argument and return a function. Here are examples of both scenarios:

1. **Take a function as an argument and return a value**:

   ```javascript
   function applyOperation(value, operation) {
     return operation(value);
   }

   function double(x) {
     return x * 2;
   }

   const result = applyOperation(5, double);
   // result is 10
   ```

   In this example, `applyOperation` takes a value and a function (`operation`) as arguments and applies the function to the value, returning the result.

2. **Take a value as an argument and return a function**:

   ```javascript
   function createMultiplier(factor) {
     return function (value) {
       return value * factor;
     };
   }

   const double = createMultiplier(2);
   const triple = createMultiplier(3);

   const result1 = double(5);
   // result1 is 10

   const result2 = triple(5);
   // result2 is 15
   ```

   In this example, `createMultiplier` takes a value (`factor`) and returns a new function that multiplies its argument by that factor. This allows you to create specialized functions (e.g., `double` and `triple`) based on a common pattern.
